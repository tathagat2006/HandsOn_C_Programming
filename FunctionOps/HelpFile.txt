in this part of FunctionOps we would learn about how to make Functions,Declare Functions in C.
Then we'll learn about the command line arguments argv,argc.
we'll also see the need of forward declaration of a function in c language.

Play around with the function calling and there declarations to learn more....

BEST OF LUCK!!
