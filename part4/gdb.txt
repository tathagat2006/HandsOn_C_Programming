/* Using Debugger */

If you are a mac user use "lldb" as the debugger.
But i'll be covering the concepts for linux OS.

type in the command : gdb ./<filename>
it will open a gdb command prompt.

type in the command in the 'run' in the gdb command line interface.

it will display the details of your ex3.c file.
and if there is any error in the file it will display that error so that you can debugg your code.

type 'bt' command to get the stack trace of the code present in your ex3.c file.

might be you have not set your debugging symbols in your make file so first either set that in  makefile or type : CFLAGS="-Wall -g" make ex3 in  the terminal after typing quit to come out of the gdb .

/* SETTING THE BREAKPOINT */

inorder to set the break point . After entering into the gdb again after doing line 16. type : "break <option>" to set your break pointer to the specified option . then type: run command.

now type "bt" and you would see some info abt your journey.

type: "step" inorder to move to the next line in the code.
typing "step" again and agin would take you more inside the printf function once you reach the line containing printf function.
type "next" to come out of that printf function .

/* EXITING OUT OF THE DEBUGGER */

type in "cont" to come at the end of the code and
